# {{site.productName}} Plugin Documentation

Plugins allow you to extend your {{site.productName}} experience by adding new screens (full screen plugins) or functionality to existing screens (inline plugins) within {{site.productName}}.  Using our [developer tool]({{site.clientDomain}}/account/developer), you can write Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build out your own custom plugin.

Some examples of full screen plugins are:

* Custom dashboards
* Gantt chart that extends our task system 
* Reports that pull in data from external systems 
* Alternate calendar that can show data from forms, or from an external calendar

Some examples of inline plugins are:

* New button that can send data from an existing form to Zapier
* UPS tracking status 
* Task hotlist that follows you from screen to screen
