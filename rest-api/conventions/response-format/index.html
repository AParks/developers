<h1>Conventions</h1>

<h2>Response Format</h2>

<p>At a high level, there are two possible response formats you will encounter. One for success conditions 
and one for failure conditions. Within those paths, parameters may vary depending on the 
<a href="/rest-api/conventions/http-verbs">verb</a> used and the 
<a href="/rest-api/conventions/response-format/#http-status">status</a> range returned.</p>

<h3 id="http-status">HTTP Status</h3>

<p>The HTTP <strong>Status</strong> header is always used to indicate success or failure at a high level. 
Statuses are used appropriately and consistently:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>200</code> range indicates success.</li>
	<li><code>400</code> range indicates errors fixable by the API consumer: authentication, bad formatting, 
	data validation issues, etc.</li>
	<li><code>500</code> range indicates errors on our end: server issues, maintenance downtime, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="success">Success</h3>

{% highlight json %}
{
	"status": 200,
	"code": 2000
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In a successful response, you will always receive a <code>status</code> in the 200 range. This is a 
duplicate of the HTTP status code. You will also receive a <code>code</code> in the 2000 range. This is 
a {{site.productName}} specific code that can be used for more context.</p>

<h4 id="success-get-post-put">GET, POST and PUT</h4>

{% highlight json %}
{
	"status": 200,
	"code": 2000,
	"totalCount": 2,
	"limit": 20,
	"offset": 0,
	"data": [
		{
			"id": 1,
			"attributeOne": "some value"
		},
		{
			"id": 2,
			"attributeOne": "some other value"
		}
	]
}
{% endhighlight %}
	
<p>A <code>totalCount</code>, <code>limit</code>, and <code>offset</code> is provided for all 
<strong>GET</strong>, <strong>POST</strong> and <strong>PUT</strong> requests.</p>

<p><code>data</code> holds information about the object(s) being fetched, created or modified. 
<code>data</code> is an array, as shown above, when representing lists of objects. In single-object 
scenarios, <code>data</code> itself becomes the object. For example:</p> 

{% highlight json %}
{
	"status": 200,
	"code": 2000,
	"totalCount": 2,
	"limit": 20,
	"offset": 0,
	"data": {
		"id": 1,
		"attributeOne": "some value"
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="failure">Failure</h3>

{% highlight json %}
{
	"status": 404,
	"code": 4004,
	"userMessage": "Error viewing data",
	"developerMessage": "No data was found"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In a failure response, you will always receive a <code>status</code> in the 
400 or 500 range. This is a duplicate of the HTTP status code. You will also receive a 
{{site.productName}} specific <code>code</code> in the 4000 range. This code can be used for better context.</p>

<p>The <code>userMessage</code> is a string containing friendly text that you can pass directly on 
to an end user. The <code>developerMessage</code> is geared towards the developer.</p>

<h4 id="failure-post-and-put-user-error">POST and PUT: User Error</h4>

{% highlight json %}
{
	"status": 403,
	"code": 4012,
	"userMessage": "Error saving data",
	"developerMessage": "Validation errors",
	"validationErrors": {
		"attributeOne": [
			"Some error message"
		],
		"attributeTwo": [
			"Some error message",
			"Some other error message"
		]
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>When invalid data has been <strong>POST</strong>ed or <strong>PUT</strong>, 
<code>validationErrors</code> will also be returned. These errors will be returned in the same keyed format 
they were provided tot he API, which means they can be programmatically passed back to an end user with 
ease. Note that each attribute contains an array with one or more errors that are associated with that 
attribute.</p>
